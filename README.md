# DSA210--Term-Project
In this term project, I will be exploring the relationship with my Instagram usage level and my focused hours.

I am Berinay Zümra Sarıel, a DSA210 student who will conduct this term project about the relationship between her social media usage and study focus time.

## MOTIVATION 

As it is a commonly known issue, social media useage has an adverse effect on one's productivity and focus time. By analyzing these two datasets together, I hope to gain valuable insights into how distractions influence my academic performance and identify patterns that can help me improve my time management.

## PROJECT IDEA

The goal of this project is to determine whether there is an **inverse relationship** between my Instagram activity and study focus time throughout this semester. Specifically:
1. I will analyze my **Instagram likes activity** to measure how active I am on the platform each day. (The reason why I did not go with the activity time is because of the requested data did not contain such a collection of total hours spent on a daily basis.)
2. I will use my **Forest app study sessions** to track the number of hours I spent studying on the same days.
3. By comparing these two datasets day by day, I aim to test my hypothesis:  
   - Higher Instagram usage corresponds to lower study time (and vice versa).  
   - This may reveal patterns about how distractions like Instagram impact productivity.

## DATA SOURCE

1. **Forest App**
   I have exported my focus session data from the app, which spans my whole  university time period of studying. I have tracked the duration of study sessions and timestamps for when they occurred. I have requested to export my personal data from the  [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/) from my phone.
   Data includes:
   - Start and end times of the study sessions.
   - Durations of each study session.
   - Metadata such as the type of tree I planted in the app (for fun context). 
   

 2. **Social Media as Instagram**
    Since Instagram (or TikTok) applies to majority of the society for distraction, I chose the one  that I use for this project. I have requested to export my Instagram Activity from the [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252).
    From that package of data, I chose to go with "Liked Posts" dataset, which contains:
    - Timestamps of likes I've given to posts or reels.
    - The associated metadata for each like (like the URL of the content and its title.)

## PROJECT PLAN

I will follow these steps to analyze the data:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Parse and clean both datasets.
   - Standardize timestamps for comparison (convert to daily totals).
   - Extract key features:
     - Total likes per day (Instagram dataset).
     - Total study hours per day (Forest dataset).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize daily Instagram activity and study time.
   - Identify patterns and outliers.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate the correlation between Instagram usage and study focus time to test my hypothesis of an inverse relationship.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Create comparative charts:
     - Line charts for daily trends.
     - Scatter plots to show the relationship between the two variables.
